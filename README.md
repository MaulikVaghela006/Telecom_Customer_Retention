# Telecom_Customer_Retention
Telecom Churn Prediction using Machine Learning:
A machine learning project that predicts customer churn in the telecom industry using Random Forest, data balancing (RandomOverSampler), and feature encoding techniques. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights for customer retention strategies.

🚀 Project Overview:

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. Predicting churn helps companies take proactive actions such as personalized offers, improving service quality, or targeted marketing.

This project builds a Random Forest–based churn prediction model with proper preprocessing and data balancing.

🧠 Tech Stack Used:

>Python

>Pandas 

>Scikit-learn

>Random Forest

>Jupyter Notebook – Experimentation & analysis

📊 Workflow of the Project:

1. Data Preprocessing

>Handling missing values

>Encoding categorical features using OrdinalEncoder

>Separating features (X) and target (y)

2. Handling Imbalanced Data

>Applied RandomOverSampler to balance the dataset

3. Model Training

>Used RandomForestClassifier to predict churn

>Split data using train_test_split

4. Model Evaluation

>Performance measured using:

>Precision

>Recall

>F1-score

🎯 End Users:

>Telecom companies

>Customer retention teams

>Marketing teams

>Data analysts / business analysts

>Business decision-makers

🌟 Benefits of This Model

✔ Reduces customer churn

✔ Improves customer retention strategies

✔ Helps in targeted marketing

✔ Provides actionable insights

✔ Enables data-driven decisions

📈 Results:

The model successfully predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their attributes.

Random Forest performed well in terms of accuracy, recall, and stability on imbalanced data.
